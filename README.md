# Hotel Assistant Chatbot  
**Zapier-Powered FAQ Automation System**

## Overview

In this project, I built a Zapier-powered hotel assistant chatbot that answers frequently asked questions using a structured knowledge base.

The objective: reduce front desk workload, provide instant guest responses, and standardize information delivery.

## Problem

Hotels regularly receive repetitive questions such as:

- Check-in and check-out times  
- Wi-Fi access details  
- Parking availability  
- Cancellation policies  
- Breakfast hours  
- Amenities and services  

Handling these manually:

- Increases front desk workload  
- Slows response times  
- Creates inconsistency in messaging  

The hotel needed a scalable, automated solution.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Structured Knowledge Base

A centralized document containing:

- Hotel policies  
- Service details  
- Room information  
- Operational hours  
- Standard response guidelines  

This ensures consistent and accurate answers.

### 2. Automation Layer — Zapier

Zapier manages the workflow:

1. Guest submits a question (chat or web form)  
2. Question is sent through the automation  
3. The AI references the structured knowledge base  
4. A formatted response is generated  
5. The answer is delivered back to the guest  

No manual intervention required for standard inquiries.

### 3. AI Processing Layer

The AI model:

- Interprets guest intent  
- Matches the question to relevant knowledge base entries  
- Generates clear, policy-aligned responses  
- Avoids hallucination by staying within structured content

## Workflow Summary

1. Guest submits question  
2. Zapier triggers automation  
3. AI references knowledge base  
4. Response generated  
5. Guest receives immediate answer  

Escalation logic can route complex questions to staff if needed.
